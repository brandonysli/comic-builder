# Comic Builder

This website is dedicated to ENGL 1167 FWS: Reading Now taught by Oona Cullen. The website allows you to create your own comics from scratch. I built this website using a framework called React.js, and I used a library called fabric.js to allow users to draw on each comic cell. Some of the functions are being able to generate a specific number of columns and rows, drawing on the individual cells, and downloading/saving the comic as a png. This project was heavily inspired by "Understanding Comics" by Scott McCloud.

## Build with:

- React.js
- Fabric.js
- Tabler Icons
